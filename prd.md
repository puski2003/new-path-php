## 2. User Flows

### 2.1 Session Booking & Payment Flow

This is the **core revenue flow** of the platform.

```
User browses counselors
  → Views counselor profile (bio, specialty, fee, reviews, availability)
  → Selects an available time slot (weekly recurring slots)
  → SLOT LOCKED (first-come-first-served, slot marked unavailable immediately)
  → Proceeds to checkout
  → Pays via PayHere frontend checkout (LKR)
  → On payment success (return URL):
      1. Session record created (status: "scheduled")
      2. Google Meet link generated via REST API
      3. Meet link saved to session record (meeting_link)
      4. Email sent to COUNSELOR with:
         - Patient name, session datetime, session type
         - Google Meet link (clickable)
      5. Email sent to USER with:
         - Confirmation, session datetime
         - Google Meet link
      6. User redirected to payment success page
  → On payment failure/cancel (cancel URL):
      - Slot released back to available
      - User shown error, can retry
      - No session created
```

**Slot Locking:**
- When a user selects a slot and proceeds to checkout, the slot is **immediately locked** (marked unavailable)
- If another user tries to book the same slot → shown "slot no longer available"
- If payment fails or user cancels → slot **released** back to available
- First-come-first-served — no queuing

**PayHere Integration Details:**
- **Frontend-only checkout** — use PayHere's JavaScript checkout form (no server-side merchant API)
- Currency: **LKR**
- Mode: **Sandbox** (for development), switchable to production
- Flow: Generate hash on server → render PayHere checkout button → user pays → redirect to return/cancel URL
- On return URL: verify payment status via the return parameters, create session record
- Refunds: Handled **manually by admin** from PayHere merchant dashboard
- Replace all Stripe references in DB schema (`stripe_payment_intent_id` → `payhere_order_id`, etc.)
- **No server-side notify/callback URL needed** — payment verification happens on the return redirect

**Google Meet Integration Details:**
- Use **Google Meet REST API** directly (not Calendar API)
- Service account authentication
- Generate a unique meeting link per session
- Store link in `sessions.meeting_link`

### 2.2 Session Lifecycle

```
scheduled → (session time arrives) → in_progress → completed
                                   → no_show (if either party doesn't join)
scheduled → cancelled (by user or counselor)
```

**Session Duration & Extension:**
- Counselors set their default session duration (30, 60, or 90 min) and corresponding fee
- During a live session, the **user can request to extend** the session
- Extension adds 30-minute blocks at a pro-rated price
- Extension payment processed via PayHere before the extra time begins
- If no extension payment, session ends at scheduled time

**Rescheduling:**
- Counselor can request a reschedule if unable to attend
- User receives notification + email with reschedule request
- User can accept (new time) or request refund instead
- If refund: admin processes manually via PayHere dashboard

**Post-Session:**
- Counselor can write `session_notes` (private to counselor only, NOT visible to user or admin)
- Counselor can write `counselor_private_notes` (also counselor-only)
- User can rate the session (1-5 stars) and leave a review
- Counselor's average rating updates automatically

**Platform Commission:**
- The platform takes a percentage cut from each session payment
- Commission rate configurable via `system_settings` table
- Counselor earnings = session fee − platform commission
- Commission tracked in `counselor_payouts` table

### 2.3 Recovery Plan Flow

```
Counselor creates plan for a user they have a booked session with
  → Plan created with status "draft"
  → Counselor adds goals (short-term/long-term) and tasks (phased)
  → Counselor publishes plan (status: "active", assigned_status: "pending")
  → User receives notification + email
  → User can:
      - ACCEPT the plan → assigned_status: "accepted", user starts working on tasks
      - REJECT the plan → assigned_status: "rejected", counselor notified
      - User CANNOT modify the plan (read-only)
  → User works through tasks phase by phase
  → Completing all tasks → plan status: "completed"
```

**Key Rules:**
- Counselors can ONLY create plans for users who have **booked at least one session** with them
- Counselors can create plans **before or after** the session
- Users can also create **self-directed plans** (`plan_type: "self"`) independently
- Plans can be paused/resumed by the user

### 2.4 Counselor Application Flow

```
Visitor fills out counselor application form:
  - Full name, email, phone
  - Title, specialty, bio
  - Experience years, education, certifications
  - Languages spoken, consultation fee
  - Availability schedule
  - Upload supporting documents (certificates, licenses)
  → Application saved (status: "pending")
  → Admin receives notification

Admin reviews application:
  → Views submitted info + uploaded documents
  → Can add admin_notes
  → Approves or rejects:
      - APPROVED: System auto-creates user account (role: "counselor") + counselor profile
        → Applicant receives email with login credentials
      - REJECTED: Applicant receives email with rejection reason
```

### 2.5 Community Flow

```
User creates a post (general, success_story, question, support_request, resource)
  → Can attach an image
  → Can post anonymously
  → Other users can: like, comment, share, save, report
  → Reported posts → admin review queue
  → Admin can: hide/delete post OR ban the reporting user
```

### 2.6 User Progress Tracking

```
Daily check-in: mood, energy, sleep quality, stress level, notes
Urge logging: intensity, trigger category, coping strategy used, outcome
Sobriety tracker: days_sober counter, milestones
Journal entries: categorized (gratitude, progress, challenge, reflection)
Achievements: badge system based on days/milestones reached
```

### 2.7 Email Notifications (All)

| Event | Recipient | Content |
|-------|-----------|---------|

## 3. Counselor Role — Feature Specification

### 3.1 Counselor Dashboard

| Widget | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Today's sessions | List of sessions for today with Meet links, patient names |
| Upcoming sessions | Next 7 days of scheduled sessions |
| Recent clients | Quick access to recent client profiles |
| Stats cards | Total clients, total sessions, rating, pending plans |
| Session calendar | Monthly view with color-coded session statuses |
| Notifications | Recent alerts (new bookings, plan responses, etc.) |

### 3.2 Sessions Management

- **View all sessions**: filterable by status (scheduled, completed, cancelled, no_show)
- **Session detail**: patient info, datetime, Meet link (clickable to join), session type
- **Post-session actions**:
  - Mark as completed
  - Write session notes (private, counselor-only)
  - Write private notes
- **Request reschedule**: select new time from own availability, sends notification to user
- **Cancel session**: with cancellation reason, triggers refund request to admin

### 3.3 Client Management

- **Client list**: all users who have booked sessions with this counselor
- **Client profile view**:
  - Basic demographics only (name, age, gender)
  - Session history with this counselor
  - Recovery plans assigned by this counselor
  - **NOT visible (GDPR/data privacy compliance)**:

    - ❌ Daily check-in history (mood, energy, sleep, stress)
    - ❌ Urge logs
    - ❌ Journal entries
    - ❌ Community posts
    - ❌ Other counselor's data or plans
  - **Rationale**: Under data protection principles (GDPR/Sri Lanka's Personal Data Protection Act), sensitive health and behavioral data should not be shared with third parties (including counselors) without explicit, informed user consent. Recovery tracking data is self-reported for the user's own benefit and should remain private unless the user explicitly chooses to share specific data with their counselor.

- **Create plan**: only for users who have at least one booking with this counselor
  - Title, description, category

  - Each task: title, description, type, priority, due date, recurring option
  - Save as draft or publish immediately
- **View plan**: see plan + user's progress on tasks
- **Delete plan**: soft-delete with confirmation

### 3.5 Counselor Profile Management

  - Toggle slots on/off
- **View own reviews**: ratings and review text from users

- **Create support group**: name, description, category, meeting schedule, max members 
- **Only admins** can create groups
- **Users join freely** — no approval needed
- **Dual format**:
  1. **Real-time text chat**: Built-in group messaging within the platform
     - Persistent message history
     - Members can send text messages

     - Meeting link visible to all group members
- **Admin can**: deactivate groups, remove members, moderate chat

**Real-Time Chat Technical Approach:**
- Use **AJAX polling** (every 3-5 seconds) for simplicity — no WebSocket server needed
- Messages stored in a `support_group_messages` table
- Message schema: `message_id`, `group_id`, `user_id`, `content`, `created_at`
- Load last 50 messages on page load, poll for new ones
- Future: upgrade to WebSocket for true real-time

### 4.10 Admin Permissions

- **All admins have full access** — no permission levels or restrictions
- The `is_super_admin` flag in the DB is reserved for future use
- Any admin can manage users, counselors, content, finances, and settings

### 4.11 System Settings

- **Platform settings**: site name, maintenance mode, default values, **platform commission rate**
- **Configurable via `system_settings` table** (key-value pairs)

### 6.2 Page Pattern (MVC-ish)

Each page folder follows this pattern (already established):
```
feature/
├── index.php               # Entry point, routes to controller
├── feature.controller.php  # Handles request, calls model, passes to layout
├── feature.model.php       # Database queries
└── feature.layout.php      # HTML/PHP template
```

### 6.3 Environment Variables

```env
# Existing
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_NAME=new_path_2
DB_USER=root

```

### 6.4 Authentication & Authorization

- **Session-based auth** (PHP native sessions)
- Role stored in `$_SESSION['role']` after login
- Separate login pages: `/auth/login/user`, `/auth/login/counselor`, `/auth/login/admin`
- Auth middleware checks role per route:
  - `/pages/counselor/*` → requires `role === 'counselor'`
  - `/pages/admin/*` → requires `role === 'admin'`
  - `/pages/user/*` → requires `role === 'user'`

## 9. Non-Functional Requirements

| Requirement | Specification |
|-------------|---------------|
| **Response Time** | Pages load within 2 seconds |
| **Security** | Password hashing (bcrypt), SQL injection prevention (prepared statements), XSS prevention, CSRF tokens |
| **File Uploads** | Max 10MB per file, allowed: jpg, png, pdf, doc. Stored locally, path configurable via `.env` |
| **Browser Support** | Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge (latest 2 versions) |
| **Mobile** | Responsive design (existing CSS handles this) |
| **Session Timeout** | 30 minutes of inactivity |
| **Audit Trail** | All admin actions logged to `audit_logs` table |

---

## 9.1 Data Privacy & Protection (GDPR / Sri Lanka PDPA Compliance)

Since this platform handles **sensitive health and behavioral data**, the following privacy rules apply:

| Data Type | User Sees | Counselor Sees | Admin Sees |
|-----------|-----------|----------------|------------|
| Profile info (name, age, gender) | ✅ Own | ✅ Booked clients only | ✅ All |
| Session history | ✅ Own | ✅ Own sessions only | ✅ All |
| Session notes | ❌ | ✅ Own notes only | ❌ |
| Recovery plans (counselor-created) | ✅ Assigned to them | ✅ Created by them | ❌ |
| Recovery plans (self-created) | ✅ Own | ❌ | ❌ |
| Sobriety days / progress tracker | ✅ Own | ❌ | ❌ |
| Daily check-ins (mood, energy, etc.) | ✅ Own | ❌ | ❌ |
| Urge logs | ✅ Own | ❌ | ❌ |
| Journal entries | ✅ Own | ❌ | ❌ |
| Community posts | ✅ Public | ❌ (not in counselor view) | ✅ Moderation |
| Payment transactions | ✅ Own | ✅ Own earnings | ✅ All |
| Achievements | ✅ Own | ❌ | ❌ |

**Key Principles:**
- **Data Minimization**: Counselors only see data necessary for their professional role (demographics + session/plan context)
- **Purpose Limitation**: Self-reported health tracking data (check-ins, urge logs, journals) exists solely for the user's personal benefit
- **No Silent Data Sharing**: If future features allow users to share tracking data with counselors, it must be **explicit opt-in** with clear consent
- **Right to Deletion**: Users can request account deletion; all personal data must be purged (admin retains anonymized transaction records only)

## 10. Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| PayHere sandbox limitations | Payment testing may differ from production | Test edge cases thoroughly, document sandbox vs. production differences |
| Google Meet API rate limits | Meet link generation may fail during high traffic | Queue requests, retry with backoff, cache links |
| Email deliverability | Emails may land in spam | Use reputable SMTP provider, configure SPF/DKIM |
| Counselor no-show after payment | User frustration, refund burden | Auto-no-show detection, clear refund policy, admin alerts |
| Large file uploads | Server storage/performance | File size limits in .env, validate server-side, plan cloud migration |

---

## 11. Out of Scope (Future)

- Real-time chat (WebSocket-based) between user and counselor
- Mobile native apps (iOS/Android)
- AI-powered recovery plan suggestions
- Video calling within the platform (relying on Google Meet)
- Multi-language support
- Advanced analytics/BI dashboards
- Cloud file storage (planned, `.env` ready)
